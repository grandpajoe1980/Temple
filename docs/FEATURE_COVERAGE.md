## mobile (MAUI) project (DeveloperBalance sample)
The MAUI app in `9.0/Apps/DeveloperBalance` appears unrelated to Temple core feature set (likely example / seed). Not integrated with server APIs.

## high-priority gaps to address next (suggested sequence)
1. Security Hardening
   - Stripe webhook signature verification & real SDK integration
   - Rate limiting per tenant + route groups
   - Email delivery adapter (verification, password reset) + abstraction
2. Core Domain Completion
   - Lessons endpoints (CRUD + publish)
   - Custom roles CRUD & dynamic capability hash regeneration
   - Presence & channel management (chat.read capability, create channel endpoint)
3. Automation & Events
   - Implement trigger dispatcher (DonationReceived, NewMemberJoined)
   - Flesh out DailyContentRotation logic (rotation, caching)
4. Media Minimal Slice
   - Enhance storage: real provider integration, processing pipeline
5. Notifications
   - Preference model + queued dispatcher (Hangfire job)
6. Search
   - Include lessons & events description; add simple Postgres FTS indices
7. Privacy & Compliance
   - User data export + delete endpoints
8. Internationalization Baseline
   - Introduce i18n resource files & helper to surface resolved terms

## quick win hardening items
- Protect Hangfire dashboard with capability or role policy.
- Add query param tenant fallback for dev parity with docs (optional).
- Add swagger tags & version grouping.
- Add integration tests for auth, schedule, donations initiate, chat REST.

## data model discrepancies (docs vs code)
| Model | Docs Field Missing in Code | Code Field Missing in Docs | Notes |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| TenantUser | CustomRoleLabel, CapabilitiesJson (planned) | N/A | TenantUser not yet reviewed in code (assumed present) |
| Donation | ProviderDonationId (docs), MetaJson | ProviderPaymentId, ProviderDataJson, Status, UpdatedUtc, Recurring flag naming | Align naming (ProviderDonationId vs ProviderPaymentId) |
| MediaAsset | Entire model | N/A | Needs creation |
| AutomationRule | CreatedUtc (code) | N/A | Acceptable additional audit field |
| AuditEvent | DataJson (docs) | Same | Matches |

## risks
- Security exposure via unauthenticated Hangfire dashboard.
- Inconsistent donation provider field names could complicate abstraction.
- Lack of webhook verification introduces spoof risk.
- Missing comprehensive authorization on all endpoints (spot-check needed).
- Terminology override not cached (perf) & could cause per-request DB hit.

## tracking
Consider creating GitHub issues for each üü°/üî¥ item with labels: area/security, area/chat, area/donations, etc.
